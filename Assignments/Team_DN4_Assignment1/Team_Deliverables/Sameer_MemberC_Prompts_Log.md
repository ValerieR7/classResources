1. Ingest and understand this dataset and await further instructions.   
     
2.  Provide me with the SQL queries to successfully perform DIVE. The csv data is currently uploaded in a Google Cloud Storage data lake and I'll be using BigQuery to analyze it. Go beyond basic metrics \- find surprising insights. 

3. Your role is that of a Product Performance Analyst. Each role is required to conduct a DIVE analysis. DIVE: "Discover Stage: Clear initial findings with data support Investigate Stage: Deep "why" exploration with multiple angles Validate Stage: Critical evaluation of assumptions Extend Stage: Actionable business applications"

4. Update queries 3C and 4A so that the output is shorter but still informative

5. Provide some more analyses (SQL queries) to run for each DIVE section. Recall the requirements for the role:

"For Product Performance Analyst:  
Focus Questions:  
Which products/categories perform best?  
What drives product profitability?  
Where should we focus product strategy?  
Required Analysis:  
Product profitability analysis  
Category performance comparison  
Discount impact on product success"

6. Create a word document synthesizing the analysis. Include all previous findings, and use the new findings to update analyses and strategy recommendations. 

7. Explain the findings of each DIVE area in detail

8. In Validate, the simulated no-discount scenario resulted in negative profits? Explain this  
     
9. Multiple code debugging prompts:  
   1. Step 2 didn't run. Output from step 3:  
      total\_orders	multi\_product\_orders	pct\_multi  
      5009	2469	49.29  
        
   2. 4C didn't output any info: "There is no data to display."
