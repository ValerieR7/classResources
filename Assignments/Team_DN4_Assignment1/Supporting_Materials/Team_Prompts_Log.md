Team AI Prompts Log

1. These docs were created as part of a Graduate assignment in cloud computing. The 3 roles were Member A: Sales & Revenue Analyst, Member B: Customer Behavior Analyst and Member T: Product Performance Analyst. The individual analyses were required to follow the DIVE framework: "Discover Stage (15%): Clear initial findings with data support Investigate Stage (15%): Deep "why" exploration with multiple angles Validate Stage (15%): Critical evaluation of assumptions Extend Stage (15%): Actionable business applications". The next part of the assignment is to create team deliverables: "- Executive summary document \- Integrated analysis report \- Strategic recommendations" Your task is to create these artifacts, having analyzed and synthesized the 3 reports. The team deliverables will be graded on: "Integration Quality: Findings connected meaningfully Strategic Thinking: Recommendations are actionable and impactful Communication: Clear, professional, executive-ready". Consider questions such as: \- How do these findings connect? \- What overarching story do they tell about the business? \- Based on these integrated insights: \[summary\] What are the top 5 actions this retailer should take? Consider: \- Quick wins vs long-term strategies \- Resource requirements \- Risk factors \- Success metrics". 

2. Good first draft. Here are specific requirements for each part of the deliverable: "Executive Summary (1 page) \- Top 3 unified insights from all analyses \- Critical business challenges identified \- Recommended priority actions Integrated Analysis (2-3 pages) \- How individual findings connect \- Cross-functional implications \- Conflicting findings and resolution Strategic Recommendations (1-2 pages) \- 5 specific, actionable recommendations \- Implementation timeline (30-60-90 days) \- Success metrics for each recommendation". Update/improve the document accordingly. 

3. Don't use tables, you may use bullet points instead. Also, please go one level deeper in your synthesis. Prioritize information over brevity. Don't worry if your output exceeds page recommendations. 

4. OK great output. Based on this, create the following: Team Presentation \- 5 slides: \- Problem statement \- Key findings from each analyst \- Integrated insights \- Top 3 recommendations \- Expected impact A presentation script for 3 presenters to present these 5 slides \- 1 minute each, totalling 3 minutes. 

5. Create a powerpoint version, with all of the slides and speaker notes formatted in. 

6. Prepare a script for these slides. Here's how much time each slide should take: 1\. 10 seconds 2\. 50 seconds 3\. 1 minute 4\. 40 seconds 5\. 20 seconds. There will be 3 speakers, who should speak for 3 minutes total. 

7. This presentation is academic, keep the tone as such.
